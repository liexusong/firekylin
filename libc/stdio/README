This is the  C stdio lib ,most of them are ported from MINIX3.
why do I port from MINIX3 ,not from other such as glibc ,newlibc,
uclibc ,BSD ,etc. since I read the source of the, but they have too 
much code , also they would have more functions. but they are so
big and difficulty to understand,and port . however ,the minix stdio
lib still keep small and easy.

all of this files are port form minix ,buf I do some modify.

when I bengin to implememt stdio ,I real want to as the same as ANSI C.
however ,after some days ago , I want to do something within stdio.
so I changed the inferface of stdio. all the functions the first arg
would be FILE *stream if it need.
also I wouldnot to impelement some function,such as gets,puts.etc.
now fdopen havenot impelement. MINIX do not have .
I want to impelement by myself, but I really do not do how to set these
flags. but wo should havenot use it yet.

ok,that will be a jok,I modify the inferface of stdio. Oh, if it can't
leave,I think I will modify them back.
